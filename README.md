# Supabase Hearth Pulse

KeepAlive for Supabase is an open-source tool designed to prevent Supabase free-tier databases from becoming inactive due to idle time. This tool periodically sends requests to your database to keep it running, ensuring uninterrupted service for development or low-traffic applications.

## Prerequisites

- Script uses `pnpm` as package manager. [Install pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)
- Create a dummy table in you Supabase db. This table will be used by the script to keep your db alive

```
    CREATE TABLE "your_table_name" (
    id BIGINT generated BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY,
    name text NULL DEFAULT '':: text,
    random uuid NULL DEFAULT gen_random_uuid (),
    CONSTRAINT "your_table_name_pkey" PRIMARY key (id)
);
```
